The **dubicube** package aims to deliver measures for assessing the applicability of biodiversity data cubes, whether for general use or specific biodiversity indicators. These measures facilitate data exploration by providing insights into data quality and reliability. Additionally, the package includes functions for calculating indicator uncertainty using bootstrapping, as well as tools for interpreting and visualising uncertainty in biodiversity indicators derived from occurrence cubes. 

## Installation

Install **dubicube** in R:

```r
install.packages("dubicube"", repos = c("https://b-cubed-eu.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("b-cubed-eu/dubicube")
```

## Key features of **dubicube**

The **dubicube** package provides a set of tools for assessing, interpreting, and visualising uncertainty in biodiversity indicators derived from occurrence data cubes. Its functionality is organised into three main areas:

### 1. Data exploration and variability assessment

**dubicube** includes functions to evaluate the structure and sensitivity of biodiversity data cubes, helping users understand data quality and applicability.

* `cross_validate_cube()`
  Perform cross-validation (e.g. leave-one-out or k-fold) to assess group-level sensitivity of biodiversity indicators. This helps evaluate how individual categories influence biodiversity indicator values.

> Additional data quality measures are under development and will be available in future updates.

### 2. Estimating indicator uncertainty

To quantify the uncertainty associated with biodiversity indicators derived from data cubes, **dubicube** provides bootstrap-based tools:

* `bootstrap_cube()`
  Generate bootstrap replicates of the input cube to estimate the variability, bias, and standard error of biodiversity indicators.

* `calculate_bootstrap_ci()`
  Compute confidence intervals (percentile, BCa, normal, or basic) from bootstrap distributions, optionally applying transformations or bias corrections.

### 3. Interpretation and visualisation of indicators

**dubicube** supports the interpretation of indicator values in the context of uncertainty and predefined reference or threshold values:

* `add_effect_classification()`
  Classify indicator results (e.g. increase, stable, decrease) by comparing confidence intervals to user-defined references and thresholds.
