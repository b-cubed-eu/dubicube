## Introduction

When calculating biodiversity indicators from a cube, we often want confidence intervals (CIs) using bootstrapping. In **dubicube**, bootstrapping can be done in two ways:

* **Whole-cube bootstrapping**: resampling all rows in the cube, regardless of grouping.
* **Group-specific bootstrapping**: resampling rows only within a group of interest (e.g., a species, year, or habitat).

The choice between these two methods directly affects how confidence intervals should be interpreted:

* Other indicators **combine information across groups** (e.g., community richness, turnover, or multi-species metrics). These require whole-cube bootstrapping to preserve correlations.
* Some indicators are **calculated independently per group** (e.g., species-specific or year-specific metrics). For these, group-specific bootstrapping is usually more appropriate.

In this tutorial, we explain the differences, discuss the strengths and limitations of each method, and provide a worked example.

### Whole-cube bootstrap

**Definition:** Resample all rows in the cube, regardless of species, year, or other grouping.

**Advantages:**

* Preserves correlations between groups (e.g., species co-occurrence, temporal dependencies).
* Appropriate for indicators that depend on multiple groups together (community-level metrics, multi-species diversity).

**Disadvantages:**

* Rare groups may end up with zero rows in some bootstrap replicates, leading to wider or undefined CIs.
* Variance for small groups may be inflated.

**Use case examples:**

* Community richness per site or habitat.
* Multi-species indicators (e.g., average occupancy across species).
* Temporal turnover indicators that rely on multiple years.

**Implementation in `dubicube`**

* Default use like tutorials and examples.

### Group-specific bootstrap

**Definition:** Subset the cube by the group of interest (e.g., species or year), then resample rows only within that group.

**Advantages:**

* Guarantees each replicate has rows for the group → stable CIs.
* Reflects within-group variability only.

**Disadvantages:**

* Ignores correlations with other groups.
* Variance may be slightly underestimated if the group’s presence is correlated with other groups.

**Use case examples:**

* Species-specific occupancy or habitat preference metrics.
* Year-specific indicators (e.g., annual richness).
* Small or rare groups where zero-row replicates would be problematic.

**Implementation in `dubicube`**

* Perform bootstrapping and interval calculation per group (e.g. using a for loop or `lapply()`).
* See further.
